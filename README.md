# Calendar Love üóì ‚ù§Ô∏è

Got muliple Google calendar accounts? Wish they would they all show your
actual availability regardless of which account has a scheduled event?

** Here's some calendar love for you: **

This Google Apps script looks at calendars in your other Google accounts and
puts blocks in your current account's calendar where your other accounts have
events.

Additionally, this script removes blocks from your current account's calendar
when your other calendars no longer have events.

Now your current calendar always shows your availability, taking into account
all of the events in your other calendars.

If you share all of your Google accounts' calendars with each other, then you
can install this script in all of your Google accounts and they will all stay
in sync.
